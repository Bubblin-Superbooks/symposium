<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> This, my dear Socrates,' said the stranger of Mantineia, 'is that life above all others which man should live, in the contemplation of beauty absolute; a beauty which if you once beheld, you would see not to be after the measure of gold, and garments, and fair boys and youths, whose presence now entrances you; and you and many a one would be content to live seeing them only and conversing with them without meat or drink, if that were possible&mdash;you only want to look at them and to be with them. But what if man had eyes to see the true beauty&mdash;the divine beauty, I mean, pure and clear and unalloyed, not clogged with the pollutions of mortality and all the colours and vanities of human life&mdash;thither looking, and holding converse with the true beauty simple and divine?</p></div> </div>
