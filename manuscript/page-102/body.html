<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Phaedrus began by affirming that Love is a mighty god, and wonderful among gods and men, but especially wonderful in his birth. For he is the eldest of the gods, which is an honour to him; and a proof of his claim to this honour is, that of his parents there is no memorial; neither poet nor prose-writer has ever affirmed that he had any. As Hesiod says:&mdash;</p><p>'First Chaos came, and then broad-bosomed Earth, The everlasting seat of all that is, And Love.'</p><p>In other words, after Chaos, the Earth and Love, these two, came into being. Also Parmenides sings of Generation:</p><p>'First in the train of gods, he fashioned Love.'</p></div> </div>
