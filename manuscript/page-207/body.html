<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>What do you think, Eryximachus? said Alcibiades: shall I attack him and inflict the punishment before you all?</p><p>What are you about? said Socrates; are you going to raise a laugh at my expense? Is that the meaning of your praise?</p><p>I am going to speak the truth, if you will permit me.</p><p>I not only permit, but exhort you to speak the truth.</p><p>Then I will begin at once, said Alcibiades, and if I say anything which is not true, you may interrupt me if you will, and say 'that is a lie,' though my intention is to speak the truth. But you must not wonder if I speak any how as things come into my mind; for the fluent and orderly enumeration of all your singularities is not a task which is easy to a man in my condition.</p></div> </div>
