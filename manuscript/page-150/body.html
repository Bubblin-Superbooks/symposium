<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>'Her feet are tender, for she sets her steps, Not on the ground but on the heads of men:'</p><p>herein is an excellent proof of her tenderness,&mdash;that she walks not upon the hard but upon the soft. Let us adduce a similar proof of the tenderness of Love; for he walks not upon the earth, nor yet upon the skulls of men, which are not so very soft, but in the hearts and souls of both gods and men, which are of all things the softest: in them he walks and dwells and makes his home. Not in every soul without exception, for where there is hardness he departs, where there is softness there he dwells; and nestling always with his feet and in all manner of ways in the softest of soft places, how can he be other than the softest of all things? Of a truth he is the tenderest as well as the youngest, and also he is of flexile form;</p></div> </div>
