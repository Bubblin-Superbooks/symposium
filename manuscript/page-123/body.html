Eryximachus, he said, you ought either to stop my hiccough, or to speak in my turn until I have left off.</p><p>I will do both, said Eryximachus: I will speak in your turn, and do you speak in mine; and while I am speaking let me recommend you to hold your breath, and if after you have done so for some time the hiccough is no better, then gargle with a little water;</p></div> </div>
